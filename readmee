# ECR Image Cleanup Pipeline

This GitLab CI/CD pipeline automates the cleanup of unused Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) images. It consists of two stages:

## List Image Stage

In the `list_image` stage, the pipeline performs the following tasks:

- Retrieves a list of all repositories in the specified ECR namespace.
- For each repository, retrieves all image tags.
- Identifies the unused image tags, which are those ending with `-SNAPSHOT` or `-RELEASE` and not being used by any running ECS tasks.
- Stores the unused image tags in the `unused_images.txt` file.
- Stores all image tags for each repository in the `repo_image_tags.txt` file, including those that are used.

This stage provides visibility into all image tags in the ECR repositories and identifies which ones are no longer in use.

## Delete Unused Images Stage

In the `delete_unused_images` stage, the pipeline performs the following tasks:

- Reads the `unused_images.txt` file generated in the previous stage.
- Deletes all the corresponding unused image tags from the respective repositories in the ECR namespace.

This stage helps clean up the ECR repositories by removing unused image tags, thereby optimizing storage usage and ensuring a more efficient container image management process.

### Note

- Ensure that appropriate AWS credentials are configured as environment variables in the GitLab CI/CD settings.
- The AWS CLI must be installed and configured with the necessary permissions to interact with ECR.
- Adjust the ECR namespace (`ECR_NAMESPACE`) and any other parameters as per your specific setup.
