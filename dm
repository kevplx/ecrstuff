h1. Proposal: Replicating Masked Data File Workflow in AWS

h2. Overview

This proposal outlines three potential approaches to replicate the legacy Connect:Direct-based masked data file transfer process in AWS. Each option provides a mechanism to move masked data files from a production environment to a QA environment, allowing QA testers to perform manipulations before ingesting the data for testing.

h2. Option 1: Automated File Transfer via AWS Lambda

Description:
A masked data file is placed in an S3 bucket in the production AWS account. An AWS Lambda function listens for new objects in the source folder and automatically copies the file to a designated S3 bucket/folder in the QA environment. QA testers can then retrieve the file, perform the necessary manipulations locally, and manually upload the modified file to the ingestion S3 bucket.

Effort Required:

Medium: Requires setup of S3 buckets, Lambda function, IAM roles, and cross-account permissions (if applicable).

Moderate scripting effort to ensure file validation and logging.

Pros:

Fully automated transfer reduces manual errors.

Simple, event-driven architecture using native AWS services.

Minimal QA tester training required.

Easily auditable via CloudTrail and Lambda logs.

Cons:

Still requires manual manipulation/upload of the file after QA changes it.

No UI for file visibilityâ€”QA must know where to download/upload files.

Difficult to trace if files are accidentally modified or misplaced after transfer.

h2. Option 2: Controlled Transfer via GitLab CI/CD Jobs

Description:
Files are moved through controlled GitLab jobs. A QA tester or developer can trigger a pipeline, passing in parameters (e.g., file name, source, destination). The job uses AWS CLI or SDK commands to move the file between S3 buckets.

Effort Required:

Medium to High: Requires CI/CD pipeline scripting, GitLab Runner setup, secret management, and permissions configuration.

Requires clear documentation and training for testers to use job variables properly.

Pros:

Controlled and auditable file movements.

Encourages discipline and logging of who moved what, when, and where.

Fully integrates with existing GitLab CI/CD workflows.

Cons:

Requires familiarity with GitLab and pipelines.

Slightly higher learning curve for QA testers.

More manual compared to Lambda automation.

Triggering jobs for each file can be cumbersome for bulk processing.

h2. Option 3: Angular Web UI for S3 File Management

Description:
A custom Angular-based web application allows users to view files in a source S3 folder and select files to download. After making the necessary changes locally, users can upload the manipulated file to a target S3 folder. This app would include basic file browsing, upload/download functionality, and optional metadata tagging.

Effort Required:

High: Requires front-end development, S3 integration (via AWS SDK), authentication (e.g., Cognito), permission controls, and secure deployment.

DevOps setup for hosting the web app (e.g., in S3 or ECS) and handling secure access.

Pros:

User-friendly UI for testers and non-technical users.

Clear visibility into files available, transferred, or pending.

Can be enhanced over time with approval workflows or audit logs.

Cons:

Highest upfront development and maintenance effort.

Security risks must be carefully managed (S3 access, identity management).

Longer lead time to deliver MVP.

h2. Summary Comparison Table

|| Option || Description || Effort || Pros || Cons || |--|--|--|--|--|--| | 1 | Lambda Automation | Files auto-copied from Prod S3 to QA S3 | Medium | Simple, fast, low-maintenance | No UI, manual final upload | | 2 | GitLab CI/CD Jobs | File movement controlled via GitLab variables | Medium-High | Controlled, auditable, integrates with CI/CD | Steeper learning curve for testers | | 3 | Angular Web UI | Full-featured web interface for QA testers | High | Friendly UI, scalable, intuitive | High effort, needs secure hosting |

h2. Recommendation

If the priority is low overhead and quick implementation, Option 1 (Lambda automation) is recommended. If auditability and controlled handling are critical, Option 2 (GitLab Jobs) is suitable. For long-term usability and non-technical access, Option 3 (Angular Web UI) offers the best UX but requires higher investment.
